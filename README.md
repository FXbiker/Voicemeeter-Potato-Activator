# Voicemeeter-Potato-Activator (Kinda)
Resets the cooldown timer in the registry every time you try to open voicemeeter

- To use: Download .bat file from repo and run as admin

Thats it!
Re-run if the timer returns (maybe after an update) and report on github

# What the script does: 

The script is simple with two lines, you can read it for yorself but it simple changes the "code" value in reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\VB-Audio\VoiceMeeter" to "738879" and launches voicemeeterx64
